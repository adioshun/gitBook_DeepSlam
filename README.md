- SLAM algorithms are complementary to ConvNets and Deep Learning: 
    - SLAM focuses on geometric problems 
    - Deep Learning is the master of perception (recognition) problems. 

> If you want a robot to go towards your refrigerator without hitting a wall, use SLAM. If you want the robot to identify the items inside your fridge, use ConvNets.


- SLAM is a real-time version of Structure from Motion (SfM)
