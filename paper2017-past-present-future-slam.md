----------

    - active SLAM and exploration, 
    - and other new frontiers. 


 - 최종 질문 : Do robots need SLAM? and Is SLAM solved?
 
 
 ## I. INTRODUCTION
 
- SLAM comprises the simultaneous  
    - 상태 측정 : estimation of the **state of a robot** equipped with on-board sensors, 
    - 지도 생성 : the construction of a **model (the map)** of the environment that the sensors are perceiving. 

###### In simple instances,

- 로봇 상태는 포즈`(포지션, 방향)`나 기타 정보`(속도, 오차, 파라미터)`로 표현 할수 있다.  : `the robot state is described by `
    - its pose (position and orientation), 
    - although other quantities may be included in the state, 
        - such as robot velocity,sensor biases, and calibration parameters. 


- 지도는 랜드마크/장애물 위치등 관심 영역으로 표현 할수 있다. `The map is a representation of aspects of interest (e.g.,position of landmarks, obstacles) describing the environment in which the robot operates.`


- 지도가 필요한 두가지 이유 `The need to use a map of the environment is two fold.`
    - 첫째 다른 Task에 활용하기 위해  `First, the map is often required to support other tasks; `
        - 예 : 경로 설정,  `for instance, a map can inform path planning or provide an intuitive visualization for a human operator. 
    - 둘째, 로봇의 State측정시 발생하는 에러를 제한 하기 위해 `Second, the map allows limiting the error committed in estimating the state of the robot. `
        - 지도가 없다면, dead-reckoning이 빠르게 확산될것이다. `In the absence of a map, dead-reckoning would quickly drift over time; `
        - 지도가 있다면, 위치 에러를 알려진 지역의 re-visiting를 통해 재설정 가능하다. `on the other hand, using a map, (e.g.,a set of distinguishable landmarks), the robot can “reset” its localization error by re-visiting known areas (so-called loop closure). `

- 따라서 SLMA은 지도가 없어 생성해야 하는 서비스에서도 활용이 가능하다. `Therefore, SLAM finds applications in all scenarios in which a prior map is not available and needs to be built.`


- 일부 환경에서는 랜드마크가 미리 정의되어 있다. `In some robotics applications the location of a set of landmarks is known a priori. `
    - 예를 들어 비콘등을 이용하여 위치 정보를 미리 알려 준다. `For instance, a robot operating on a factory floor can be provided with a manually-built map of artificial beacons in the environment. `
    - 또는 실내지만 GPS를 수신할수 있는 환경도 랜드마크가 알려진것으로 볼수 있다. `Another example is the case in which the robot has access to GPS (the GPS satellites can be considered as moving beacons at known locations). `
    - 이런 알려진 랜드마크를 이용하여 localization이 가능한 시나리오에서는 SLAM이 꼭 필요 하지 않다. `
In such scenarios, SLAM may not be required if localization can be done reliably with respect to the known landmarks.`


- The popularity of the SLAM problem is connected with the emergence of indoor applications of mobile robotics. 
    -     
 
 ###### [1986-2004 : classical age] 
      
- 20년간의 SLAM 문제 연구에 대한 추천 서베이 논문 : [7, 69]`A thorough historical review of the first 20 years of the SLAM problem is given by Durrant-Whyte and Bailey in two surveys [7, 69]. `


- [7, 69]의 주요 내용은 classical age(1986-2004)에 대한 내용이다. `These mainly cover what we call the classical age (1986-2004); `
    - the classical age saw the introduction of the main probabilistic formulations for SLAM,
    - including approaches based on 
        - Extended Kalman Filters, 
        - RaoBlackwellised Particle Filters, 
        - and maximum likelihood estimation;
    - moreover, it delineated the basic challenges connected to efficiency and robust data association. 


- classical age의 연구의 참고 문헌 들 `Two other excellent references describing the three main SLAM formulations of the classical age are` 
    - the book of Thrun, Burgard, andFox [240] and 
    - the chapter of Stachniss et al. [234, Ch. 46].

###### [2004-2015 : algorithmic-analysis age] 

- 이후의 연구는 algorithmic-analysis age (2004-2015)라고 불리우고 [64]에 잘 설명되어 있다. `The subsequent period is what we call the algorithmic-analysis age (2004-2015), and is partially covered by Dissanayake etal. in [64]. `
    - The algorithmic analysis period saw the study of fundamental properties of SLAM, 
    - including 
        - observability,
        - convergence, and 
        - consistency. 
    - In this period, 
        - the key role of sparsity towards efficient SLAM solvers was also understood,
        - and the main open-source SLAM libraries were developed.

- SLAM 서베이 논문들을 표 1에 정리 하였다. 최근 서베이 논문들은 특정 aspects이나 SLMA의 sub-fields에 초점을 두고 있었다. ` We review the main SLAM surveys to date in Table I,observing that most recent surveys only cover specific aspects or sub-fields of SLAM. `


- 지난 30년간 SLAM이 인기 있었던것은 SLAM이 포함하는 aspects 만 봐도 알수 있다. `The popularity of SLAM in the last 30years is not surprising if one thinks about the manifold aspects that SLAM involves. `
    - At the lower level (called the front-end in Section II) SLAM naturally intersects other research fields such as 
        - computer vision and 
        - signal processing; 
    - at the higher level (that we later call the back-end), SLAM is an appealing mix of 
        - geometry, 
        - graph theory, 
        - optimization, 
        - and probabilistic estimation. 
    - Finally, a SLAM expert has to deal with practical aspects ranging 
        - from sensor calibration 
        - to system integration. 


- 최근 논문 들은 SLAM에 대한 오버뷰와 연구 방향을 제시 하고 있다. `The present paper gives a broad overview of the current state of SLAM, and offers the perspective of part of the community on the open problems and future directions for the SLAM research. `

- 우리의 주 관심은 **metric**과 **semantic SLAM**이다. 추천할 만한 서베이논문은 [160]이다. `Our main focus is on metric and semantic SLAM, and we refer the reader to the recent survey by Lowry etal. [160],`
    - 이논문은 비젼 기반 place recognition과 topological SLAM에 대하여 다루고 있다. ` which provides a comprehensive review of vision based place recognition and topological SLAM.`

### SLAM에 대한 두가지 논의 점 

- 좀더 깊게 들어 가기 전에 아래 두 물음에 대하여 살펴 보자 `Before delving into the paper, we first discuss two questions that often animate discussions during robotics conferences: `
    - (1) do autonomous robots need SLAM? and 
    - (2) is SLAM solved as an academic research endeavor? 
- 이 질문에 대하여서는 후반부에 다시 언급하겠다. `We will revisit these questions at the end of the manuscript.`

####  Q 1 : Do autonomous robots really need SLAM?


- 첫번째 질문에 답변하기 위해서는 무엇이 SLAM을 Unique하게 만드는지 이해 해야 한다. `Answering the question “Do autonomous robots really need SLAM?” requires understanding what makes SLAM unique.`

- 슬램의 목표는 글로벌하고 일관된 representation을 생성 하는것이다. S`LAM aims at building a globally consistent representation of the environment,`
    - leveraging both ego-motion measurements and loop closures. 

- 키워드는 loop closure이다. `The keyword here is “loop closure”:`
    - loop closure를 포기 하면 odometry를 줄일수 있다. `if we sacrifice loop closures, SLAM reduces to odometry. `

- 초창기에는 odometry는 바퀴 인코더를 통해서 얻었다. `In early applications, odometry was obtained by integrating wheel encoders. `

- 바퀴 odometry 로 예측한 Pose는 쉽게 drifts되어 몇미터만 이동하여도 쓸모없게 된다. `The pose estimate obtained from wheel odometry quickly drifts, making the estimate unusable after few meters[128, Ch. 6]; `


- 이것이 스램을 개발하는데 문제점이다. `this was one of the main thrusts behind the development of SLAM:` 
    - 랜드마크를 관찰하는 방법은 이런 trajectory drift를 줄여 주고 보정도 가능하게 한다. `the observation of external landmarks is useful to reduce the trajectory drift and possibly correct it [185]. `
    - 최근의 odometry 알고리즘은 비쥬얼 기반이며 inertial 정보를 사용하여 매우 작은 에러를 가진다. ` However, more recent odometry algorithms are based on visual and inertial information, and have very small drift(< 0.5% of the trajectory length [82]). `

따라서, 첫번째 질문은 다음과 같이 3가지로 legitimate된다. ` Hence the question becomes legitimate: do we really need SLAM? Our answer is three-fold.`

##### Q 1.1

- 최근 10년간의 슬램 연구들은 visual-inertial odometry알고리즘을 itself produced해다. `First of all, we observe that the SLAM research done over the last decade has itself produced the visual-inertial odometry algorithms that currently represent the state of the art, e.g., [163, 175];` 

- 이런 관점에서 VIN은 SLAM이다. `in this sense Visual-Inertial Navigation(VIN) is SLAM:`
    - VIN은 loop closure가 제거된 간소화(Reduced)된 SLAM시스템이다. ` VIN can be considered a reduced SLAM system, in which the loop closure (or place recognition) module is disabled. `

- SLAM은 센서 퓨전에 대한 연구를 이끌어 왔다. `More generally, SLAM has directly led to the study of sensor fusion under more challenging setups (i.e., no GPS, low quality sensors) than previously considered in other literature (e.g., inertial navigation in aerospace engineering).`

##### Q 1.2

- 두번째 대답은 true topology에 관한 것이다. `The second answer regards the true topology of the environment.`

![](https://i.imgur.com/0KbpSfo.png)

```
[Fig. 1: Left:]
- map built from odometry. 
- The map is homotopic to a long corridor that goes from the starting position A to the final position B. 
- Points that are close in reality (e.g., B and C) may be arbitrarily far in the odometric map.

[Fig. 1: Right:]
- map build from SLAM. 
- By leveraging loop closures, SLAM estimates the actual topology of the environment, and “discovers” shortcuts in the map.
```

- odometry를 수행하며 LC를 무시하면 로봇은 세상을 “infinite corridor”로 간주 하게 된다. `A robot performing odometry and neglecting loop closures interprets the world as an “infinite corridor” (Fig. 1-left) in which the robot keeps exploring new areas indefinitely.`


-LC는 로봇에게 corridor가 겹치는걸 알려 준다. `A loop closure event informs the robot that this “corridor”keeps intersecting itself (Fig. 1-right). `

- LC의 장점은 다음과 같다. `The advantage of loopclosure now becomes clear: by finding loop closures,`
    - 토폴로지를 이해 할수있고 `the robot understands the real topology of the environment, `
    - 최단 경로를 계산 할수 있다. `and is able to find shortcuts between locations (e.g., point Band C in the map). `

- 따라서 정확한 토폴로지를 아는게 SLAM의 장점 이라면 왜 metric를 drop하고 단순히 place recognition만 하지 않는 것인가? `Therefore, if getting the right topology of the environment is one of the merits of SLAM, why not simply drop the metric information and just do place recognition? `
    - 답변은 간단하다. Metric정보는 place recognition를 쉽게 하도록 도와 주면 강건성이 증가 한다. `The answer is simple: the metric information makes place recognition much simpler and more robust; `
    - metric reconstruction는 로봇에게 LC가 가능하게 한다. `the metric reconstruction informs the robot about loop closure opportunities and allows discarding spurious loop closures [150].`

- Therefore, while SLAM might be redundant in principle (an oracle place recognition module would suffice for topological mapping), SLAM offers a natural defense against wrong data association and perceptual aliasing, where similarly looking scenes, corresponding to distinct locations in the environment,would deceive place recognition. 

- In this sense, the SLAM map provides a way to predict and validate future measurements:we believe that this mechanism is key to robust operation


##### Q 1.3 

- 세번째 대답은 SLAM은 globally consistent map을 필요로 하는 많은 서비스에 필요로 한다. `The third answer is that SLAM is needed for many applications that, either implicitly or explicitly, do require a globally consistent map. `

- 예를 들어 대부분의 로봇의 목표는 주변을 돌아 다니면서 지도를 사용자에게 전달 하는 것이다. `For instance, in many military and civilian applications, the goal of the robot is to explore an environment and report a map to the human operator, ensuring that full coverage of the environment has been obtained.`

- 또 다른 예로는 구조물에 대한 검사를 하는 롯봇이다. 이 경우에 **globally consistent 3D reconstruction**는 꼭 필요 하다. `Another example is the case in which the robot has to perform structural inspection (of a building, bridge, etc.); also in this case a globally consistent 3D reconstruction is a requirement for successful operation.`

#### Q 2 : is SLAM solved?

- 이 질문은 로보틱스 커뮤니티에서 자주 회자 되는 질문이다. `This question of “is SLAM solved?” is often asked within the robotics community, c.f. [87]. `

- 이 질문은 특정환경/로봇/성능에 따라 다르므로 답변하기 어려운 주제이다. `This question is difficult to answer because SLAM has become such abroad topic that the question is well posed only for a given robot/environment/performance combination. `


- SLAM기술이 완벽한지 평가 하려면 아래 사항들에 대하여 정의 되어야 한다. `In particular,one can evaluate the maturity of the SLAM problem once the following aspects are specified:`
    - robot: 
        - type of motion (e.g., dynamics, maximum speed), 
        - available sensors (e.g., resolution, sampling rate), 
        - avail-able computational resources;
    - environment: 
        - planar or three-dimensional, 
        - presence of natural or artificial landmarks, 
        - amount of dynamic elements, 
        - amount of symmetry and risk of perceptual aliasing. 
        - Note that many of these aspects actually depend on the sensor-environment pair: for instance, two rooms may look identical for a 2D laser scanner (perceptual aliasing), while a camera may discern them from appearance cues;
    - performance requirements: 
        - desired accuracy in the estimation of the state of the robot, 
        - accuracy and type of representation of the environment (e.g., landmark-based or dense), 
        - success rate (percentage of tests in which the accuracy bounds are met), 
        - estimation latency, 
        - maximum operation time, 
        - maximum size of the mapped area

- 예를 들어 아래 상황에 대한 SLAM은 Mature하다고 볼수 있다. 
    - `For instance, mapping a 2D indoor environment with a robot equipped with wheel encoders and a laser scanner,with sufficient accuracy (< 10cm) and sufficient robustness(say, low failure rate), can be considered largely solved (an example of industrial system performing SLAM is the Kuka Navigation Solution [145]). `
    - 비슷한 비젼 기반 SLMA역시 Mature한 연구 결과이다. `Similarly, vision-based SLAM with slowly-moving robots (e.g., Mars rovers [166], domesticrobots [114]), and visual-inertial odometry [94] can be considered mature research fields.`
  
      
- 하지만 다른 상황에 대한 SLAM은 Mature하다고 볼수 없다. `On the other hand,`
    - other robot/environment/performance combinations still deserve a large amount of fundamental research. 


- 오늘날 SLAM알고리즘들은 로봇의 모션이나 환경이 challenging 하면 좋은 성과를 보이지 않는다. `Current SLAM algorithms can be easily induced to fail when either the motion of the robot or the environment are too challenging (e.g., fast robot dynamics, highly dynamic environments); `
    - similarly, SLAM algorithms are often unable to face strict performance requirements, 
        - e.g., high rate estimation for fast closed-loop control. 

###### [2016- : the robust-perception age] 

- 본 논문에서는 SLAM연구가 새로운 전기를 맞이 하고 있다고 본다. `In this paper, we argue that we are entering in a third era for SLAM,` 

- robust-perception age는 아래의 요구사항을 가진다. `the robust-perception age, which is characterized by the following key requirements:`

1. robust performance: 
    - the SLAM system operates with low failure rate for an extended period of time in a broad set of environments; 
    - the system includes fail-safe mechanisms and has self-tuning capabilities[[1]](#11) in that it can adapt the selection of the system parameters to the scenario.

2. high-level understanding: 
    - the SLAM system goes beyond basic geometry reconstruction to obtain a high-level understanding of the environment 
    - (e.g., high-level geometry, **semantics**, physics, affordances);

3. resource awareness: 
    - the SLAM system is tailored to the available sensing and computational resources, and provides means to adjust the computation load depending on the available resources;
    
4. task-driven perception: 
    - the SLAM system is able to select relevant perceptual information and filter out irrelevant sensor data, 
    - in order to support the task the robot has to perform; moreover, the SLAM system produces adaptive map representations, whose complexity may vary depending on the task at hand.

## II. ANATOMY OF A MODERN SLAM SYSTEM

- The architecture of a SLAM system includes two main components: 
    - the front-end 
    - the back-end. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/ZX089mc.png)
```
[Fig. 2: Front-end and back-end in a typical SLAM system.]
-  The back-end can provide feedback to the front-end for loop closure detection and verification.
```

- **The front-end** abstracts sensor data into models that are amenable for estimation, 

- **The back-end** performs inference on the abstracted data produced by the front-end. 

### 2.1 Maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation and the SLAM back-end.

- SLAM의 공식들은 [161], [101]을 기반을 두고 있다. `The current de-facto standard formulation of SLAM has its origins in the seminal paper of Lu and Milios [161], followed by the work of Gutmann and Konolige [101].`

- 위 내용을 기반으로 개선된 방식[63, 81, 100, 125, 192, 241]들이 제안 되었다. `Since then, numerous approaches have improved the efficiency and robustness of the optimization underlying the problem[63, 81, 100, 125, 192, 241]. `

- 위 모든 방식들은 SLAM을 **MAP**문제로 보고 있다. 일부는 ** factor graphs [143] ** 를 사용한다. `All these approaches formulate SLAM as a maximum a posteriori estimation problem, and often use the formalism of factor graphs [143] to reason about the interdependence among variables.`

- 변수 X를 측정한다고 가정해 봅시다. SLAM에서 변수 X는 일반적으로 trajectory of the robot`(discrete set of poses)`이나 랜드마크의 위치 입니다.  `Assume that we want to estimate an unknown variable X ; as mentioned before, in SLAM the variable X typically includes the trajectory of the robot (as a discrete set of poses) and the position of landmarks in the environment. `

- We are given a set of measurements $$Z = \{z_k : k = 1, ...,m\} $$ such that each measurement can be expressed as a function of X , i.e.$$z_k = h_k(X_k)+\epsilon _k$$, 
	- $$X_k \subseteq X$$ is a subset of the variables,
	- $$h_k(·)$$ is a known function (the measurement or observation model), 
	- $$ \epsilon_k$$ is random measurement noise.

- In MAP estimation, we estimate $$X$$ by computing the assignment of variables $$X\star $$ that attains the maximum of the posterior $$p (X \mid Z)$$  (the belief over $$X$$ given the measurements):

$$
x\star = argmax_x p(X \mid Z) = argmax x P(Z \mid x)p(x) 
$$
- where the equality follows from the Bayes theorem.



### 2.2 Sensor-dependent SLAM front-end



## III. LONG-TERM AUTONOMY I: ROBUSTNESS


## IV. LONG-TERM AUTONOMY II: SCALABILITY

## V. REPRESENTATION I: METRIC MAP MODELS

- 본장에서는 geometry 를 어떻게 SLAM에 모델링 하는지 알아 보겠다. `This section discusses how to model geometry in SLAM.`

- More formally, a **metric representation** (or metric map) is a **symbolic structure** that encodes the geometry of the environment.

- 알맞은 metric representation를 선택 하는것은 중요 하다. `We claim that understanding how to choose a suitable metric representation for SLAM (and extending the set or representations currently used in robotics) will impact many research areas, `
	- including long-term navigation, physical interaction with the environment, and human-robot interaction.


- Geometric modeling appears much simpler in the 2D case, with only two predominant paradigms: 
	- landmark-based maps and 
	- occupancy grid maps. 


- 첫번째는 : The former models the environment as a sparse set of landmarks, 

- 두번째는 : the latter discretizes the environment in cells and assigns a probability of occupation to each cell. 

- 2D상에서 이러한 representations 표준화에 걸림돌은 `IEEE RAS Map Data Representation`워킹 그룹이다. ` The problem of standardization of these representations in the 2D case has been tackled by the IEEE RAS Map Data Representation Working Group, `
	- 이 워킹 그룹은  which recently released a standard for 2D maps in robotics [113]; the standard defines the two main metric representations for planar environments(plus topological maps) in order to facilitate data exchange, benchmarking, and technology transfer.


- 3D geometry 모델링 문제는 좀더 예민하고, Mappling중에 3D geometry를 효율적으로 모델링 하는가에 대한 문제는 아직 초보적인 수준이다. `The question of 3D geometry modeling is more delicate, and the understanding of how to efficiently model 3D geometry during mapping is in its infancy. `

- 본 장에서는 **metric representations**에 대하여 넓은 관점`(로보틱스, 컴퓨터 비젼, CAD, 컴퓨터 그래픽)`에서 살펴 보겠다.  `In this section we review metric representations, taking a broad perspective across robotics,computer vision, computer aided design (CAD), and computer graphics. `

- 사용된 분류는  [80, 209, 221]를 기반으로 한다. `Our taxonomy draws inspiration from [80, 209, 221],and includes pointers to more recent work.`

### 5.1 Landmark-based sparse representations.



### 5.2 Low-level raw dense representations



### 5.3 Boundary and spatial-partitioning dense representations.


### 5.4 High-level object-based representations.


### 5.5 Open Problems. 


## VI. REPRESENTATION II: SEMANTIC MAP MODELS

- Semantic mapping consists in associating semantic concepts to geometric entities in a robot’s surroundings. 


- 최근 geometric maps만 사용하는것의 단점으로 인해 시멘틱 멥핑에 대한 관심이 시작 되었다. ` Recently, the limitations of purely geometric maps have been recognized and this has spawned a significant and ongoing body of work in semantic mapping of environments,`
	-  in order to enhance robot’s autonomy and robustness, 
	- facilitate more complex tasks (e.g. avoid muddy-road while driving), 
	- move from path-planning to task-planning, 
	- and enable advanced human-robot interaction[9, 26, 217]. 


- These observations have led to different approaches for semantic mapping which vary in the numbers and types of semantic concepts and means of associating them with different parts of the environments. 

 - As an example, 
	 - Pronobis and Jensfelt [206] label different rooms, (룸별 식별)
	 - while Pillaiand Leonard [201] segment several known objects in the map. (물체 식별)

```
[206] A. Pronobis and P. Jensfelt. Large-scale semantic mapping and reasoning with heterogeneous modalities. In Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA), pages 3515–3522. IEEE, 2012.
```
- With the exception of few approaches, semantic parsing at the basic level was formulated as a classification problem,where simple mapping between the sensory data and semantic concepts has been considered.

### 6.1 Semantic vs. topological SLAM. 

- 토폴로지 맵핑은 metric정보를 잃어 버리고 오직 공간인식`(place recognition)`을 이용하여 그래프를 생성한다. 그래프의 각 노드는 식별가능한 Place이고 그래프의 엣지는 place간의 접근도이다.  `As mentioned in Section I, topological mapping drops the metric information and only leverages place recognition to build a graph in which the nodes represent distinguishable “places”, while edges denote reachability among places. `

- 토폴로지 맵핑은 원래 시맨틱 맨틱과는 다르다는 것을 알아야 한다. `We note that topological mapping is radically different from semantic mapping. `

- 첫번째는 이전에 본 장소에 대한 인식이 필요한 반면, 두번째는 시멘틱 레벨에 따른 공간 분류에 관심을 둔다. ` While the former requires recognizing a previously seen place (disregarding whether that place is a kitchen, a corridor, etc.), the latter is interested in classifying the place according to semantic labels.`

- 이와 관련된 비젼 기반 토폴로지 SLAM 서베이 논문은 [160]을 참고 하기 바란다. 이 방식의 챌리지들은 3장에 설명되어 있다. `A comprehensive survey on vision-based topological SLAM is presented in Lowry et al. [160], and some of its challenges are discussed in Section III. `

- 다음장에서는 시맨틱 맵핑에 대하여 초점을 맞추겠다. `In the rest of this section we focus on semantic mapping.`

### 6.2 Semantic SLAM: Structure and detail of concepts. 

- The unlimited number of(, and relationships among,) concepts for humans opens a more philosophical and task-driven decision about the level and organization of the semantic concepts. 

- The detail and organization depend on the context of what, and where, the robot is supposed to perform a task, and they impact the complexity of the problem at different stages. 

###### [A semantic representation is built by defining the following aspects:]

- Level/Detail of semantic concepts
	- For a given robotic task,e.g. “going from room A to room B”, coarse categories(rooms, corridor, doors) would suffice for a successful performance, 
	- while for other tasks, e.g. “pick up a tea cup”,finer categories (table, tea cup, glass) are needed.

- Organization of semantic concepts: 
	- The semantic concepts are not exclusive. 
	- Even more, a single entity can have an unlimited number of properties or concepts. 
		- A chair can be “movable” and “sittable”; a dinner table can be“movable” and “unsittable”. 
		- While the chair and the table are pieces of furniture, they share the movable property but with different usability. 
	- Flat or hierarchical organizations, sharing or not some properties, have to be designed to handle this multiplicity of concepts.

### 6.3 Brief Survey. 

- There are three main ways to attack semantic mapping, and assign semantic concepts to data.

#### A. SLAM helps Semantics

- 처음에는 시멘틱 맵핑을 직설적인 접근법으로 수행 하였다. 즉, 고전적인 SLAM방식으로 생성된 Metric Map에 segmenting(??의미 부여를) 하였다. `The first robotic researchers working on semantic mapping started by the straightforward approach of segmenting the metric map built by a classical SLAM system into semantic concepts. `

- 초창기 연구는 [176]이다. 이 방식은 2D 레이저 스캐너를 이용하여 geometric map 을 생성하고 associative Markov network으로 식별된 semantic places를 Fuse하였다(오프라인방식).` An early work was that of Mozos et al. [176], which builds a geometric map using a 2D laser scan and then fuses the classified semantic places from each robot pose through an associative Markov network in an offline manner.` 

- 이와 비슷한 연구는 [148]이다. 이 방식은 RGB-D를 이용하여 3D 지도를 만들고 물체 분류`(object classification)`를 적용 하였다(오프라인). `Similarly, Lai et al. [148] build a 3D map from RGB-D sequences to then carry out an offline object classification. `


- 온라인 시멘틱 방식은 [206]에서 제안 되었다. 이 방식은 레이다와 카메라 센서값을 기반으로 3개의 Reasoning 계층을 이용하여 시멘틱 맵을 생성한다. `An online semantic mapping system was later proposed by Pronobis et al. [206], who combine three layers of reasoning (sensory, categorical, and place) to build a semantic map of the environment using laser and camera sensors.`
	- sensory
	- categorical
	- place
	
	
- 최근 연구는 [26]이다. 이 방식은 모션 예측`(motion estimation)`을 이용하였으며 희박한 시멘틱 세그멘티이션을 서로 다른 물체 탐지 방법을 Interconnect 하여 좋은 성능을 보였다. `More recently, Cadena et al. [26] use motion estimation, and interconnect a coarse semantic segmentation with different object detectors to outperform the individual systems. `

- [201]에서는 monocular SLAM을 이용하여 비디오에서의 물체 인식 성능을 향상 시켰다. `Pillaiand Leonard [201] use a monocular SLAM system to boost the performance in the task of object recognition in videos.`

#### B. Semantics helps SLAM

- 시멘틱 맵이후에 시멘틱 정보`(semantic classes/objects)`를 이용하는 연구가 진행 되었다. Soon after the first semantic maps came out, another trend started by taking advantage of known semantic classes or objects. 

- 기본 아이디어는 지도의 물체를 인지 할수 있게 된다면 이를 이용하여 지도 예측`(estimation of that map)`의 정확도를 높이는 것이다. `The idea is that if we can recognize objects or other elements in a map then we can use our prior knowledge about their geometry to improve the estimation of that map. `

- 이와 관련된 연구들이 아래와 같이 진행 되었다. First attempts were done in 
	- small scale by Castle et al. [44] 
	- and by Civera et al. [50] with a monocular SLAM with sparse features, 
	- and by Dame et al. [56] witha dense map representation. 

- [217]에서는 RGB-D센서의 장점을 이용하여 물체 탐지 기반 SLAM을 제안 하였다. `Taking advantage of RGB-D sensors, Salas-Moreno et al. [217] propose a SLAM system based on the detection of known objects in the environment.`

#### C. Joint SLAM and Semantics inference

- 컴퓨터 비젼과 로보틱스에 능통한 연구원들은 두 학문을 합쳐서 monocular SLAM와 맵 세그멘테이션을 수행 할수 있을것이라고 생각 하였다. `Researchers with expertise in both computer vision and robotics realized that they could perform monocular SLAM and map segmentation within a joint formulation. `

- The online system of Flint etal. [79] presents a model that leverages the Manhattan world assumption to segment the map in the main planes in indoor scenes. 

- Bao et al. [9] propose one of the first approaches to jointly estimate camera parameters, scene points and objectlabels using both geometric and semantic attributes in thescene. 

In their work, the authors demonstrate the improvedobject recognition performance and robustness, at the cost of arun-time of 20 minutes per image-pair, and the limited numberof object categories makes the approach impractical for on line robot operation. 

In the same line, Hane ¨ et al. [102] solvea more specialized class-dependent optimization problem inoutdoors scenarios. Although still offline, Kundu et al. [147]reduce the complexity of the problem by a late fusion of thesemantic segmentation and the metric map, a similar idea wasproposed earlier by Sengupta et al. [219] using stereo cameras.It should be noted that [147] and [219] focus only on themapping part and they do not refine the early computed posesin this late stage. 

Recently, a promising online system wasproposed by Vineet et al. [251] using stereo cameras and adense map representation.

<a name="11">[1]</a> The SLAM community has been largely affected by the “curse of manual tuning”, in that satisfactory operation is enabled by expert tuning of the system parameters (e.g., stopping conditions, thresholds for outlier rejection).  <br/>




Indoor operation rules out the use of GPS to bound the localization error; furthermore, SLAM provides an appealing alternative to user-built maps, showing that robot operation is possible in the absence of an ad hoc localization infrastructure.
